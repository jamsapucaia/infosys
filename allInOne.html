    <h2>Q1. What are the elements of an information system? List and explain</h2>
    <p>The elements are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer Software.</li>
        <li>Computer Hardware.</li>
        <li>Communications.</li>
        <li>Databases (information).</li>
        <li>Human Resources.</li>
        <li>Procedures.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Q2. List and explain the characteristics of Valuable information</h2>
    <p>Accesible, Accurate, Complete, Economical, Flexible, Relevant, Reliable, Secure, Simple, Timely, and Verifiable.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Accessible: </strong>Information should be easily accessible by authorized users
            so they can obtain it in the right format and at the right time to meet
            their needs</li>
        <li><strong>Accurate: </strong> Accurate information is error free. In some cases, 
            inaccurate information generated because inaccurate data is fed 
            into the transformation process.</li>
        <li><strong>Complete: </strong>Complete information contains all the important facts.
            For example, an investment report that does not include all important costs is not complete.</li>
        <li><strong>Economical: </strong> Information should also be relatively economical to produce.
            Decision makers must always balance the value of information with the cost of producing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible: </strong>Flexible information can be used for a variety of purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant: </strong>Information showing that lumber prices might not be relevant
            to a computer chip manufacturer.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliable: </strong>Reliable information can be depended on.
            In many cases, the reliability of the information depends on the reliability of the data-collection method.
            In other instances, reliability depends on the source of the information.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure: </strong>Information should be secure from access by unauthorized users.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple: </strong> In fact, too much information can cause information overload,
            whereby a decision maker has too much information and is unable to determine what is really important. </li>
        <li><strong>Timely: </strong>Timely information is delivered when it is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Verifiable: </strong>This means that you can check it to make sure it is correct,
            perhaps by checking many sources for the same information,
            such as codes resources and in providing any information should contain or link to a reference.</li> 
    </ol>

    <h2>Q3. What are the main advantages of the Database approach over the file approach?</h2>
    <p>The main advantages are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data redundancy and inconsistency.</li>
        <li>Data sharing.</li>
        <li>Data security.</li>
        <li>Increased productivity of app dev.</li>
        <li>Improved data quality.</li>
        <li>Improved data accessibility and responsiveness.</li>
        <li>Improved decision support.</li>
        <li>Autonated backup and recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Q4. What is a character, a field, a record, a file? Give examples from student data.</h2>
    <p>Answer goes here...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bit (Character) - a bit is the smallest unit of data representation (value of a bit may be a 0 or 1). Eight bits make a byte which can represent a character or a special symbol in a character code.</li>
        <li>Field - a field consists of a grouping of characters. A data field represents an attribute (a characteristic or quality) of some entity (object, person, place, or event).</li>
        <li>Record - a record represents a collection of attributes that describe a real-world entity. A record consists of fields, with each field describing an attribute of the entity.</li>
        <li>File - a group of related records. Files are frequently classified by the application for which they are primarily used (employee file). A primary key in a file is the field (or fields) whose value identifies a record among others in a data file.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Q5. Why is it not a good idea to put all of an organization's data fields into one giant table
        (having, say, 5000 fields)? </br>Be specific in your answer. Provide an appropriate example. </h2>
        <p>Often the same information was stored in multiple master files.
            Made it more difficult to effectively integrate data and obtain an organization-wide view of the data.
            Also, the same information may not have been consistent between files.</p>
        <p>For example, if a student changes his address, the information may have been changed only in one copy of the master file.</p>
        <p>Another problem to this approach is the Program Data Dependency, all machines will need to have the correct application to open the file.</p>

    <h2>Q6. Explain the concept of a “Relational Database”</h2>
    <p>A relational database organizes data into tables which can be linked—or related—based on data common to each.
        This capability enables you to retrieve an entirely new table from data in one or more tables with a single query.
        It also allows you and your business to better understand the relationships 
        among all available data and gain new insights for making better decisions or identifying new opportunities.</p>

    <h2>Q9. When we say a Database is “Normalized”, what are we referring to? </h2>
    <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database.

         to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating
          redundancy and inconsistent dependency.</p>

    <h2>Q10. What is a query language? What is SQL? </h2>

        Programs which are part of the information system then transform the raw data to useful information</p>
    <p>DBMS is a group of programs used as interface between a database and application systems, or a database and the user.</p>
    <p>DB is the raw information system stored in a disk.</p>

    <h2>Q14. Explain clearly what is meant by: </br>

        ii) using Access indirectly, through an information system, to get desired output? </h2>
    <p>The system will have its own menus, input screens, outputs (query), and reports.</p>
    <p>The information system will be set up on computers and a network and will provide 
        an effective method for users to interface with the database without ever knowing they are utilizing MS Access.</p>

    <p>How much to increase compensation plans to attrack high quality employees.</p>

    <h2>Q64. What are common problems with connectivity among functional area systems.</h2>
    <p> Commonly, the systems in each area (column) have their own relational database (on disk); but
        systems in different functional areas are not connected to each other - which causes other challenges
        such inefficiencies in sharing data/information.</p> 
    <p>To overcome these challenges, organizations “throw
        out” their old, functional area systems and replace them with one extensive Enterprise Resource
        Planning (ERP) System such as SAP, where all the sub-systems serving the different functional areas tapin to one centralized database. This allows for connectivity among systems - and increases overall
        efficiencies in sharing data/information</p>

    <h2>Q65. Explain what are “legacy systems”.</br>
        What problems do such system often cause for an organization’s management? Why? </h2>
    <p>Legacy Systems are an old method, technology, computer system, or application system.</p>
    <p>The system still meets the needs it was originally designed for, but doesn’t allow for growth.
        What a legacy system does now for the company is all it will ever do.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Increased security risk: The problem with unsupported systems i
            s that they do not receive updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Incompatible with new technologies: Many legacy systems are standalone and were never designed
             to integrate with other pieces of software. While that might have been fine once, it drastically
              reduces your organization’flexibility and scalability, as well as limiting the integrations you can perform.</li>
        <li>The cost of system maintenance when using legacy systems can add up fast.
            Organizations attempting to effectively manage budgets can face difficulty in managing costs for
             both new and legacy system maintenance.</li>
    </ol>
