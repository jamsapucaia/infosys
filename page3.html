    <p></p>

    <h2>Q55. Explain the concept of “vendor managed inventory” and the role of computer systems in this.</h2>

    <p> Commonly, the systems in each area (column) have their own relational database (on disk); but
        systems in different functional areas are not connected to each other - which causes other challenges
        such inefficiencies in sharing data/information.</p> 
    <p>To overcome these challenges, organizations “throw
        out” their old, functional area systems and replace them with one extensive Enterprise Resource
        Planning (ERP) System such as SAP, where all the sub-systems serving the different functional areas tapin to one centralized database. This allows for connectivity among systems - and increases overall
        efficiencies in sharing data/information</p>

    <h2>Q65. Explain what are “legacy systems”.</br>
        What problems do such system often cause for an organization’s management? Why? </h2>

        What a legacy system does now for the company is all it will ever do.</p>
    <p></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Increased security risk: The problem with unsupported systems i
            s that they do not receive updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Incompatible with new technologies: Many legacy systems are standalone and were never designed
             to integrate with other pieces of software. While that might have been fine once, it drastically
              reduces your organization’flexibility and scalability, as well as limiting the integrations you can perform.</li>
        <li>The cost of system maintenance when using legacy systems can add up fast.
            Organizations attempting to effectively manage budgets can face difficulty in managing costs for
             both new and legacy system maintenance.</li>
    </ol>
